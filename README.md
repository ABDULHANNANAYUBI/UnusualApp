# UnusualApp
 An unusual application that you can do calculation, encryption, decryption, and play a game!


 
 Note: This project was coded using OOP logic with @furkan-taskin. Since the project is one of our first desktop applications, it is inexperienced.


 
# 1.	INTRODUCTION

In this project, we made a desktop application where users can sign up and can do calculations, encryption, decryption, and play a position guess game! You can see three different applications in this app. The first one is "The Calculator", it is a basic calculator which you can do calculations. The second one is, "Encryption/Decryption" that an application where you can simply encrypt and decrypt strings using Caesar Cipher or Vigenère cipher. And the last one is "Position Guesser" that an application that ultimately knows the position you have kept in mind based on the coordinate plane!
